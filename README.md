# ResumeProjects
This repository is intended to showcase projects I have completed.
There are three Tabluea links. These links direct you to a single data visualization.
The first link directs you to a fair and accurate way to visualize the relationship between countries' GDP per Capita and Crime Index. The motivation of the visual is to find if a correlation of these two variables may exist.
The second link leads you to a data visualization in which teaches how women are at a disadvantage in STEM fields. This visual uses data from educational and industry providers.
The third link directs you to a visual in which you will be ready to travel to the biggest international sporting event, the Summer Olympics. The next city to host is Tokyo and this guide will teach you about the venues, locate venues, and find hostels nearby.
